# PostgreSQL 

A very simple Node.js script which connects to postgres database, using 'node-postgres' module.

Use `npm start` to run this module.

The two 'client-pg.js' and 'pool-pg.js' files are only for learning the syntax and the way of connecting to the database. The main script is 'json-input.js', which receives json data to fill out relevant database fields.
