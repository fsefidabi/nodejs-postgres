# PostgreSQL 

A very simple Node.js script which connects to postgres database, using 'node-postgres' module.

Use `npm start` to run this module.

The two 'clientPg.js' and 'poolPg.js' files are only for learning the syntax and the way of connecting to the database. The main script is 'jsonInput.js', which receives json data to fill out relevant database fields.
